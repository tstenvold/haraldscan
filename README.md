Updated Notes 2016
==================
**This project is no longer maintained**. If you are going to use program use the folder 'Main'. The 'Next' folder was 
an attempt to port the program to Python 3.0 but I never fully realized this goal. Please do not submit bug reports or
MAC addresses. Please see the README in 'main\doc\' for build instructions.

Info
=============
The goal of this project was really to gain as many MAC address mapped to device vendors as possible
If you see an entry on the CLI stating that the Vendor is 'Unknown". Harald Scan probably created a file in the
same directory with the first 6 characters from the MAC address with all the information it could gain from the
device.
